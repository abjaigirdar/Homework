/*
// A. Q + A
How do we assign a value to a variable? 
-> let variable = value
How do we change the value of a variable? 
-> let newVariable = variable
How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable? 
-> let newVariable = variable
Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
-> declare: when we just declare the variable
-> assign: when we assign a value to the variable
-> define: when we declare a variable and also assign a value to it.
What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
-> when we wireframe the code in plain english before writing the actual code.
What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
-> 20/80 rule. We should spend 20% of the time brainstorming and planning and 80& of the time actually implementing the plan coding.
